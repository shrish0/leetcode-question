# Merge Sorted Arrays

## Problem Statement

Given two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, with sizes `m` and `n`, respectively, merge `nums2` into `nums1` in-place to produce a single sorted array. 

**Constraints:**
- `nums1` has a size of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements are valid and the remaining `n` elements are zeros.
- `nums2` has a size of `n`.
- Both arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.

## Example

### Input
- `nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]` (with `m = 3`)
- `nums2 = [2, 5, 6]` (with `n = 3`)

### Output
- `nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 5, 6, 6]`

### Explanation
The merged array is sorted and combines all elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.

## Approach

We use a two-pointer technique to merge the arrays in reverse order. This approach ensures that the merge operation is done in-place and efficiently.

1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - `p` points to the end of the valid elements in `nums1`.
   - `q` points to the end of `nums2`.
   - `index` points to the end of the total space in `nums1`.

2. **Merge in Reverse**:
   - Compare elements from the end of `nums1` and `nums2`.
   - Place the larger element at the `index` position in `nums1`.
   - Move the pointers accordingly.

3. **Copy Remaining Elements**:
   - If there are any remaining elements in `nums2`, copy them to `nums1`.
   - No need to copy remaining elements from `nums1` as they are already in the correct place.


## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m + n)\)
  - Both `nums1` and `nums2` are traversed once. The merging process takes linear time relative to the total number of elements in both arrays.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The merging is done in place, so no extra space is used apart from a few pointers.

## Notes

- Ensure that `nums1` has enough space to accommodate all elements from `nums1` and `nums2`.
- The method modifies `nums1` directly to hold the merged result.
