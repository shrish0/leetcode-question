To check if a string is a palindrome while ignoring whitespace, you need to ensure that spaces are skipped when comparing characters. You can achieve this by modifying the `isPalindrome` method to ignore whitespace characters.

Hereâ€™s how you can update your method to ignore whitespace:

1. **Skip Whitespace**: Adjust the `start` and `end` pointers to skip whitespace characters.
2. **Handle Non-Alphanumeric Characters**: You might want to extend this to ignore other non-alphanumeric characters (if required), but let's focus on whitespace for now.

### Explanation

1. **Skip Non-Alphanumeric Characters**: Use `Character.isLetterOrDigit` to check if the characters are alphanumeric. Skip over any characters that are not letters or digits.
2. **Case Insensitivity**: Use `Character.toLowerCase` to handle case insensitivity, ensuring that 'A' and 'a' are considered the same.
3. **Compare Characters**: After skipping non-alphanumeric characters, compare the characters at the `start` and `end` pointers.
4. **Move Pointers**: Increment `start` and decrement `end` to continue checking the next characters.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. Each character is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\). No additional space is required beyond a few variables.

This implementation ensures that whitespace and other non-alphanumeric characters are ignored, making the palindrome check accurate and efficient.
